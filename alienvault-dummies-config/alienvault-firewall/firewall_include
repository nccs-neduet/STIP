# This file includes custom rules to the ossim_firewall file after
# ossim-reconfig is run
#
# Rules starting with -A (append) get added after the default ossim rules
# Example to allow port 5666:
# -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 5666 -j ACCEPT
#
# Rules starting with -I (insert) get added before the default ossim rules
# Example to ignore all new incoming connections except for network
# 192.168.0.0/24
# -I INPUT -m state --state NEW -s ! 192.168.0.0/24 -j DROP
#
# Be careful with DENY and DROP rules, as functionality might be affected and
# you could loose the connection to the host administrative interface.  It is
# recommended to add the following line at the end of this file to always
# permit remote administration from one host or network:
# -I INPUT -s [administration IP or network] -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m multiport --dports ssh,http,https -j ACCEPT
#
