If you do not have a backup of the quorum log file, you may try to start the cluster service as 'clussvc -debug -resetquorumlog' and this will attempt to create a new quorum log file based on possibly stale information in the cluster hive. You may then stop the cluster service and restart it normally using the 'net start clussvc' command.

If this is the case and you would like to use the new disk as the quorum drive, we suggest that you stop the cluster disk service, change the drive letter(s) of this drive to Letter, start the cluster disk service and retry the restore database procedure.

Check the zone at the master server &lt;ip address&gt; to verify that zone transfer is enabled to this server. To do so, use the DNS console, and select master server&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;ip address&gt; as the applicable server, then in secondary zone &lt;domain&gt; Properties, view the settings on the Zone Transfers tab. Based on the settings you choose, make any configuration adjustments there (or possibly in the Name Servers tab) so that a zone transfer can be made to this server.
plugin_sid###12214###501###The DNS server has detected that the zone 0.in-addr.arpa has a missing or corrupted zone type in registry data. To correct the problem, you can delete the applicable zone subkey, located under DNS server parameters in the Windows 2000 registry. You can then recreate the zone using the DNS console. For more information, see "Tuning advanced server parameters" and "Add and Remove Zones" in the online Help.
plugin_sid###12214###6524###Invalid response from master DNS server at &lt;ip&gt; during attempted zone transfer of zone &lt;zone&gt;. Check The DNS server at &lt;ip&gt; and insure that it is authoritative for this zone. This can be done by viewing or updating the list of authoritative servers for the zone. When using the DNS console, select zone &lt;zone&gt; Properties at server &lt;IP address&gt; and click the Name Servers tab. If needed, you can add or update this server in the list there. As an alternative solution, you could also modify settings in the Zone Transfer tab to allow transfer of the zone to this and other DNS servers.

plugin_sid###12556###1413###The following object changes were not applied to the local Active Directory database because the local metadata for the object indicates that the change is redundant.
plugin_sid###12556###2095###During an Active Directory replication request, the local domain controller (DC) identified a remote DC which has received replication data from the local DC using already-acknowledged USN tracking numbers. Because the remote DC believes it is has a more up-to-date Active Directory database than the local DC, the remote DC will not apply future changes to its copy of the Active Directory database or replicate them to its direct and transitive replication partners that originate from this local DC. If not resolved immediately, this scenario will result in inconsistencies in the Active Directory databases of this source DC and one or more direct and transitive replication partners. Specifically the consistency of users, computers and trust relationships, their passwords, security groups, security group memberships and other Active Directory configuration data may vary, affecting the ability to log on, find objects of interest and perform other critical operations. To determine if this misconfiguration exists, query this event ID using http://support.microsoft.com or contact your Microsoft product support. The most probable cause of this situation is the improper restore of Active Directory on the local domain controller. User Actions: If this situation occurred because of an improper or unintended restore, forcibly demote the DC. Remote DC: &lt;DC&gt; Partition: CN=Configuration,DC=usn,DC=loc USN reported by Remote DC: &lt;value&gt; USN reported by Local DC: &lt;value&gt;.

The incoming change to attribute 9017e (dnsRecord) will be backed out in an attempt to make the update fit. In addition to the change to the attribute not being applied locally, the current value of the attribute on this system will be sent out to all other systems to make that the definitive version. This has the effect of nullifying the change to the rest of the enterprise. The reversal may be recognized as follows: version &lt;version&gt;, time of change &lt;date&gt; &lt;time&gt; and USN of &lt;number&gt;.

If WINS still does not start, begin with a fresh&nbsp;&nbsp;copy of the database. To do this: 1) Delete all the&nbsp;&nbsp;files in the %%SystemRoot%%\system32\WINS directory. NOTE: If the WINS database file (typically named wins.mdb) is not in the above directory, check the registry for the full filepath. Delete the .mdb file. NOTE: If jet*.log are not in the above directory, check the registry for the directory path. Delete all log files 2) Restart WINS.

If the tombstone interval & timeout intervals are not correct (i.e. too small -- being &lt;&lt; the replication interval), the above condition is possible. This is because the records might get changed into tombstones and then deleted before the remote WINS can pull them. In the same vein, if the refresh interval is set to be&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt; replication interval then the records could get released before a WINS can pull them (a released record is not sent).

plugin_sid###13652###4165###Wins has encountered an error that is causing it to shut down.
plugin_sid###13652###4243###WINS Pull thread encountered an exception during the process of sending a push notification to another WINS. The exception code is given below in the data section.
plugin_sid###13652###4291###WINS tried to get its addresses but failed.
plugin_sid###13652###4204###WINS could not read from the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) socket.
plugin_sid###13652###4338###The WINS server started the burst handling of incoming requests. WINS does this  to handle a sudden increase of incoming requests. WINS will also log an event  indicating when the burst handling stops. If you see this event frequently, you  may want to upgrade the WINS server to a faster computer. You can also try to  adjust the burst handling count using the WINS Manager tool.
plugin_sid###13652###4337###The WINS Server could not initialize security to allow the read-only operations.
plugin_sid###13652###4119###WINS got a packet that has the wrong format (for example, a label may be more than 63 octets).

plugin_sid###13652###4245###WINS TCP Listener thread encountered an exception.
plugin_sid###13652###4157###WINS did not send a notification message to the WINS server whose address is given in the data section. There were a number of communications failures with that server in the past few minutes.
plugin_sid###13652###4102###Connection was aborted by the remote WINS
plugin_sid###13652###4124###The WINS server received an update notification from the non-configured WINS&nbsp;&nbsp;server at the address, &lt;ip address. The WINS server rejected it. This means the remote WINS server is not in the list of Push partners (WINS servers under the Pull key) and the administrator has prohibited (using the registry) replication with non-configured WINS servers. If you want this WINS server to accept update notifications from non-configured WINS servers then set the Wins\Paramaters\RplOnlyWCnfPnrs value in the registry to 0.
plugin_sid###13652###4299###The following name, "&lt;name&gt;", is too long. Valid NetBios names must not exceed 15 characters. The name has not been entered in the WINS database.
plugin_sid###13652###4224###WINS encountered a database error. This may or may not be a serious error. WINS will try to recover from it. You can check the database error events under 'Application Log' category of the Event Viewer for the Exchange component, ESENT, source to find out more details about database errors. If you continue to see a large number of these errors consistently over time (a span of few hours), you may want to restore the WINS database from a backup. The error number is in the second DWORD of the data section.
plugin_sid###13652###4177###The WINS Push configuration key could not be created or opened. Check to see if the permissions on the key are set properly, system resources are low, or the registry is having a problem.
plugin_sid###13652###4294###The client does not have the permissions required to execute the function.
plugin_sid###13652###4129###The NetBios over TCP/IP (NetBT) key could not be queried.
plugin_sid###13652###4211###The WinSock send function returned with an unexpected error.
plugin_sid###13652###4156###WINS could not initialize the administrator interface because of a problem with&nbsp;&nbsp;the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) service. You may not be able to administer WINS. Make sure that the RPC service is running.
plugin_sid###13652###4250###WINS did not find any subkeys under the Pull key.
plugin_sid###13652###4305###The length of the message sent by another WINS indicates a very big message. There may have been corruption of the data. WINS will ignore this message, terminate the connection with the remote WINS, and continue.
plugin_sid###13652###4139###WINS replication request is being ignored since WINS suspects that the Wins\Partners key information has changed (because it got a notification from the Registry) which makes the current request pertaining to partner old.
plugin_sid###13652###4262###WINS got an error while trying to register a unique replica with name &lt;computer name&gt;. The replica is owned by WINS with address given below.
plugin_sid###13652###4307###The replicator PULL thread of WINS ecountered an exception while processing a request. Check other log entries to determine what went wrong.
plugin_sid###13652###4257###WINS sent a name query or a name release with a certain transaction ID. It received a response to the request that differed either in the name that it&nbsp;&nbsp;contained or in the operation code. WINS has thrown the response away.

plugin_sid###13652###4147###WINS has deleted records of a partner. The internal ID of the partner whose records were deleted, the minimum version number (low word, high word), and the maximum version number (low word, high word) of the records deleted are given in the data section.
plugin_sid###13652###4253###WINS did not find any subkeys under the Push key.
plugin_sid###13652###4295###When WINS replicated with its partners, one of the partners showed there was more data that actually existed. WINS adjusted its counter so that new registrations and updates are seen by its partners. This means that recovery did not work properly. You may want to check which of the partners has the highest version number corresponding to the local WINS. Shut down WINS and restart after specifying this number in the registry.
plugin_sid###13652###4260###WINS got an error while registering replicas. It will not register any more replicas of this WINS (address is in data section 4th-8th byte; also check previous log entry) at this time. Please check a previous log entry to determine the reason for this. If this error persists over time i.e. you get the same error during subsequent replication with the above partner WINS, you may want to restore the database from the backup.
plugin_sid###13652###4202###An attempt to connect to the remote WINS server with address &lt;ip address&gt; returned with an error. Check to see that the remote WINS server is running and available, and that WINS is running on that server.
